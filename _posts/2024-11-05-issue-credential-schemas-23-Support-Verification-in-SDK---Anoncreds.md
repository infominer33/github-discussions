excerpt: >
  > OIDC itself only uses a 'flat' structure with singular values for everything    Yes, which is quite unfortunate, as our experience is that information in credentials often do not have a flat structure (especially when you start combining credential data about the same individual).    > This could lead to a mismatch between 'name' in OIDC    Yes, and to put a finer point on how different information models fail to capture properties like \"name\" properly, see \"Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names\":    https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/    No one said data modelling was easy. :P
