title: "[TO DISCUSS] Add AI transcription to WG meetings"

  1. The AI summaries need to be vetted/reviewed afterwards to make sure they capture the specific actual messages/nuances expressed in the meetings.
  2. PLEASE make sure you continue to record and curate the recordings.  Some of the other DID WGs don't do this and a lot is lost - particularly if the minutes don't have a lot of fidelity.
  Cheers

@kimdhamilton Is it possible to activate an AI meeting notetaker at Zoom account level so that it automatically takes notes? Would people be comfortable meetings being recorded and/or having an AI notetaker?
