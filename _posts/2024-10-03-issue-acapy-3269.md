  I agree. For this scenario testing against a postgres db would be easier and better. The sqlite testing was much more difficult with restarts in acapy-tools. Also would be good to have postgres getting tested more here in general.

In the acapy tools repo there is some really useful testing using docker containers that allows testing of upgrade scripts and restarts. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-tools/tree/main/askar_tools/tests/e2e.

It should be possible to support this in the scenarios directory from acapy itself. It would be awesome to be able to test a supported upgrade path from the last LTS version and test a few different restarts with changed configurations such as making public dids and using seeds etc.
