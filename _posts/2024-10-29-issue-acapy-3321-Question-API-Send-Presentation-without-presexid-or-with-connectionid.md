Hi there, 

I am using aca-py for my master's thesis and trying to achieve the trust between user and my system. 

What I am trying to achieve is to expose the system's VC to the user's wallet so they can be sure that they have connected with the right entity.

Is there a way to send VC presentation without needing a request first?

Thanks in advance!
