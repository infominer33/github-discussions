  Hi @swcurran,    Thank you for your detailed answer.     I should maybe check out AnonCreds for now in my case, but I am going to watch the given zoom recording as well thank you for that.    Best,

Hi there, 

I am using aca-py for my master's thesis and trying to achieve the trust between user and my system. 

What I am trying to achieve is to expose the system's VC to the user's wallet so they can be sure that they have connected with the right entity.

Is there a way to send VC presentation without needing a request first?

Thanks in advance!
