  I guess that making the PR myself would require becoming a WebAppSec WG member, but I don't believe this little change should earn me that. Feel free to do it!

During the HMAC key generation operation it is never mentioned to set the `HmacKeyAlgorithm` `length` property. However, it is mentioned in the key import step 12: `Set the length attribute of algorithm to length.`

I suppose there should be a `Set the length attribute of algorithm to length.` step in key generation.

This is checked by [generateKey/successes_HMAC](https://wpt.live/WebCryptoAPI/generateKey/successes_HMAC.https.any.html) in WPT.
