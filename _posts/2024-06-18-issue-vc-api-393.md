title: "Add `raw-private` (and possibly `raw-public` and `raw-secret`) key formats?"

  Yes please! We ship a series of helper methods to make importing the raw bytes of an `Ed25519` private key more ergonomic for developers. All it does is to increase the attack surface of our library (which I've proposed to remove in https://github.com/anza-xyz/solana-web3.js/issues/47 at the expense of developer experience) where a platform API to import raw private key bytes would do just fine.

Currently, it's not possible to import or export a raw private X25519, Ed25519, ECDH or ECDSA key.

The spec [says](https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#dom-keyformat-raw) `raw` is "An unformatted sequence of bytes. Intended for secret keys." However, in the mentioned asymmetric algorithms it's actually used to import and export public keys. And unlike with `pkcs8`, `spki` and `jwk`, there's no natural way to tell from the format name and/or data whether it's a private or a public key.

So, we could introduce a `raw-private` key format for importing and exporting raw private keys.

Conversely, we could introduce `raw-public` for importing and exporting raw public keys, and deprecate the usage of `raw` for that purpose.

To complete the trio, we could introduce `raw-secret` for importing and exporting raw secret keys, and deprecate `raw` entirely.

(In the future, when we add ML-KEM, we may also want `raw-seed` to import/export the private key seed.)
