  ye possibly. your fix takes it a little further with the ability to pass in a key. but maybe that could be a feature for another time. the core of the issue should be fixed

Closes #1250 

# Other changes
I believe switching the pipelines has caused a whole lot of new tests to run in askar mode, so there's plenty of new test failures.
* in aries_vcx, add support for expanding verkeys read from ledgers (abbreviated with ~ prefix, expanded into full verkey)
* rm mysql wallet tests for now, i don't believe these ever worked for askar, we may need to look into it if we want to support it
* askar wallet `verify` function only worked if the signer key is owned by the wallet; not useful for verify external signers
* change the from_seed to from_secret_bytes in askar key generation (similar to #1224 ), however i've taken the easy path out by just swapping it in-place
* small issues with the `unpack` alg, where the reported sender_vk was missing 1 step of base58 decoding.
* just using a dummy in-memory askar wallet for tests/agents currently. i left a TODO comment, but i think we can defer this for solving later, it will require consideration of how we want to make storage path configurable (previously we just let indy select some default location)
* pin the mediator build image to our globally used rust toolchain version (1.79)
