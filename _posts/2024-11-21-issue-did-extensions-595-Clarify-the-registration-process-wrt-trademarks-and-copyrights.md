The current specification doesn't say that in order to block or remove a registration that a /registered/ trademark is required. The language around copyright is also problematic (granting a copyright holder the broad ability to block a registration). The text needs to be updated to remove much of the evaluation burden from the maintainers (by requiring that the trademark owner has the burden of proof). The purpose of this issue is to track this desired clarification.
