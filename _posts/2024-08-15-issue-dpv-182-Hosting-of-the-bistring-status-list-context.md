[_https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/182_](https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/182)

Hello, I have a small question on referencing the Bitstring Status List context in VCDM 1.0 credentials:

With https://github.com/w3c/vc-bitstring-status-list/issues/91 and https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org/pull/3662, we can refer to the `Status List 2021` context through w3c perma-ids.

I am under the impression however that this same change prevents referencing the bistring status list context that's here: https://github.com/w3c/vc-bitstring-status-list/blob/main/contexts/v1.jsonld

Is this second context intended to be hosted too, should implementers that use VCDM 1.0 with bitstring status lists reference it from somewhere else, or am I simply missing the correct url to reference it ?

Kind regards.
