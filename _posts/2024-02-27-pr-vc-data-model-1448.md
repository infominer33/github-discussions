title: "docs: connectionless proof"

excerpt: >
  I think we need to describe what \"accepting an invite\" means. If you're working with an SDK that's more clear as they have methods, but I think these docs are a bit more generic, and open-agent-centric right? So do we need to describe how to unpack it, build the message to send? (seems verbose)
