  ok yeah if it isn't exposed at the signature scheme API level I think it's fine to leave it off then. Thank you @Wind4Greg

If the holder is to never present the base VC it feels like it would be valuable information for a verifier to know that they have received a derived proof that is a full disclosure.

There is probably something technical with the indexes that can help them determine it but I wonder if this information should be easily accessible or at least specified in this spec.
