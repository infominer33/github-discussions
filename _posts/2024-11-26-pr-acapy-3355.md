With the removal of the in-memory wallet we lost the ability to quickly spin up an in-memory agent without a wallet name or key. This adds the ability back if you use the new `--wallet-test` config. It will create an in-memory askar wallet.

If you don't use `wallet-test` and fail to supply name and key you now get a wallet-name and wallet-key required for persistent wallet error on startup.
