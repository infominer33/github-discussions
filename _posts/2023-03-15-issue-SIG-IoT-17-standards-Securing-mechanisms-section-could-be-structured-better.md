[_https://github.com/decentralized-identity/SIG-IoT/issues/17_](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/SIG-IoT/issues/17)

this is not urgent, but Securing Mechanisms section could be organized clearer I think. some thoughts:

- I think sd-bls uses data integrity, so should be moved to embedded
- would really encourage to separate crypto (BBS) from the format as much as possible (might not be always possible)
- enveloped section should probably be bulleted into JWT and SD-JWT, COSE (not sure what is a better name for mdoc), SD-CWT
