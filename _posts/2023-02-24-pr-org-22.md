  This sounds great @andorsk 
  
  I think it would be best if everything mentioned in the primary goals would be open and housed under DIF. It would probably also be useful to include the pilot Manager / Service Provider as a reference for anyone looking to use the protocol.

1. Adds a new option `reason` to `verificationFail` so test report can see why verification should have failed
2. Adds a new test that simulates what happens when transformation options are invalid.

Statement tested: "The transformation options MUST contain a type identifier for the cryptographic suite (type), a cryptosuite identifier (cryptosuite), and a verification method (verificationMethod). "
