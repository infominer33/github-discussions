  @zacknewman I think your conclusion is accurate - clients are expected to conform to the normative algorithm definitions.

There has been some confusion across multiple issues, so creating another one ðŸ« .

In #2058, spec text was added to only zero out AAGUIDs for none attestations when the authenticator was *not* a platform authenticator.

Proposal is to remove this change altogether, which would allow AAGUIDs from security keys to not be zeroed out.

Remove:
```
If authenticator is not a [platform authenticator](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#platform-authenticators) then replace the [aaguid](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#authdata-attestedcredentialdata-aaguid) in the [attested credential data](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#attested-credential-data) with 16 zero bytes.
```

This makes the behavior the same across all authenticator types from the client perspective.
