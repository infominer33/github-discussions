[_https://github.com/w3c/did-extensions/issues/590_](https://github.com/w3c/did-extensions/issues/590)

For example, 
- did:ns -> http://did-ns.directory
- did: object -> http://did-object.directory

There would be *no requirement* to implement or use the registered domain. It would be like buying an automobile license plate and never placing it on a vehicle (which is OK).

Second, this would remove the W3C from the _conflicting method name_ problem.

Third, existing W3C registrations would be "grandfathered in"; i.e. not required to have the DNS name registration but it would still be recommended.

Other thoughts?
