(With caveat that I'm writing this after having read only from start to the end of section 2.2.4, and read the last use-case, and that perhaps somewhere in between lies the key to this issue. If that is the case, it means that the key needs to be brought earlier. If not, disregard the caveat and proceed to reading the below as though I had finished proof-reading the entire doc.)

If the Threat Model summarized in the last [use-case](https://w3c.github.io/identity-web-impact/#pure-digital-credentials) is of importance, I suggest it be more clearly stated.

It is introduced at the very end of [section 2.2.4](https://w3c.github.io/identity-web-impact/#opportunities-and-threats) by a Note that says "W3C is handling this issue with a [Threat Model](https://w3c.github.io/identity-web-impact/#a5)." (which is problematic as it implies endorsement; see #1 )

But then the use case merely summarizes a 35-page document that lacks a clear standing and is hosted elsewhere.

There is a discrepancy between the implied endorsement of a threat model and a use-case which summarizes what appears to be introductory slides from 2021.

If the threat model that is summarized is what the W3C Team recommends "W3C as an org" considers to handle the issue, then it needs to be framed in such a way. Furthermore, for the recommendation to have teeth, the reader has to understand the path W3C would take to handle the issue and to trust the threat model's standing.

Also "the issue" is unclear. Re-reading again section 2.2.4, it appears that "the issue" is [from the first "note" in this section] "enabling this technological innovation by being aware of the threats to Privacy, security, and Human Rights", where "this technological innovation" refers to "digital identities and credentials".
