Resolves #3283

The `tenant_authentication` has been updated to also allow access to the base wallet when the route matches a path defined using `--base-wallet-routes`.

Please note that, when compared to the previous implementation, the matcher has been made more greedy to tighten security: if an extra route of `/test` is specified, the matcher will only match that and not `/testA` or `/test-something-else` as it appears it would have done before.

One drawback of having to use this matcher inside the decorator is that I could not think of an elegant way of caching the compiled pattern for reuse - suggestions on how to achieve that, if desirable/required, will be welcome.
