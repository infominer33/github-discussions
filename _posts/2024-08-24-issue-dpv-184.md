  Thanks for the response @msporny.
  
  From specification perspective for now could be useful for everyone to be aware of such scenario by:
  1. Changing one of the example to include the `credentialStatus` as an array with multiple `BitstringStatusList` entries and another entry with type other than `BitstringStatusList`.
  2. Have explicitly written the expected behaviour, example: \"first entry in the array that matches the `statusPurpose`\". This way, issuers and verifiers will be aware what to expect and aware what would happen if there are double entries.
  
  As for a way to make this work better, I don't see another path forward as for adding additional binding identification parameter both to `BitstringStatusList` and `BitstringStatusListEntry`. Not sure how much desire there is for this, as the thing being handled here is incorrect usage of the feature.
