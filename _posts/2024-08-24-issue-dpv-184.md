  Thanks for the response @msporny.
  
  From specification perspective for now could be useful for everyone to be aware of such scenario by:
  1. Changing one of the example to include the `credentialStatus` as an array with multiple `BitstringStatusList` entries and another entry with type other than `BitstringStatusList`.
  2. Have explicitly written the expected behaviour, example: \"first entry in the array that matches the `statusPurpose`\". This way, issuers and verifiers will be aware what to expect and aware what would happen if there are double entries.
  
  As for a way to make this work better, I don't see another path forward as for adding additional binding identification parameter both to `BitstringStatusList` and `BitstringStatusListEntry`. Not sure how much desire there is for this, as the thing being handled here is incorrect usage of the feature.

The `credentialSubject` property of a document can contain a one or more items inside. The https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/ document is taking the assumption that there will be only a single credential subject item, and that item can be used for further status check.

It is not possible to use the `credentialSubject.id` as it is in no way linked to the VC's `credentialStatus` that is being checked.

It is no possible to use `credentialSubject.statusPurpose` as there might be multiple credential subject with the same `statusPurpose`.

How to pick the correct credential subject for the given credential status check?
