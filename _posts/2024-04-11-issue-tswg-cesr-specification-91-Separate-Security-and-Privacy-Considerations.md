[_https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-cesr-specification/issues/91_](https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-cesr-specification/issues/91)

At the moment, the specification has a ["Security and Privacy Considerations"](https://w3c.github.io/did-resolution/#security-privacy-considerations) section.

In a W3C specification, these should be separated into a "Security Considerations" section and a "Privacy Considerations" section.
