title: "Securing Mechanisms section should require that its entries are actually securing mechanisms"

excerpt: >
  The group discussed this on the 2024-11-19 telecon:
  
  @dlongley explained the issue -- effectively wallets shouldn't present proofs that they don't understand. Wallet implementers need to be warned that they don't have to throw out proof types they don't know, but at the same time, they shouldn't present proofs they don't understand. Proofs that are not understood should never be presented (e.g. base proofs for BBS). @jandrieu asked why the proofs need to be stripped -- @dlongley said that the information might be private to the individual and the \"user agent\" needs to do a good job of protecting the holder's PII. @jandrieu is concerned that this will result in a user's data rights being infringed upon. @msporny noted that we need to find the right balance of respecting user data rights and right to leave a system and not accidentally allowing transmission of private keys. @TallTed noted that being able to transmit anything does not equate to being required to transmit everything -- restrictions exist for a reason (dangers posed to individuals).
  
  A PR should be raised that instructs wallet implementers that they must not include a proof that they do not understand in a presentation.

https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#verification says to look up a media type in https://w3c.github.io/vc-specs-dir/#securing-mechanisms (or other mechanisms known to the implementation) and that the result "MUST implement the interface described in [[5.12 Securing Mechanism Specifications](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#securing-mechanism-specifications)]." But nothing in this registry constrains the editors to only accept specs that implement that interface. This puts an unnecessary burden on implementations to check every entry in the registry themselves and only use it if it implements the interface.

I don't think the editors should need to check the quality of the securing mechanisms, just that they provide the right interface.
