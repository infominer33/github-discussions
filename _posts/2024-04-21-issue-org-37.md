excerpt: >
  The group discussed this on the 2024-11-19 telecon:
  
  @dlongley explained the issue -- effectively wallets shouldn't present proofs that they don't understand. Wallet implementers need to be warned that they don't have to throw out proof types they don't know, but at the same time, they shouldn't present proofs they don't understand. Proofs that are not understood should never be presented (e.g. base proofs for BBS). @jandrieu asked why the proofs need to be stripped -- @dlongley said that the information might be private to the individual and the \"user agent\" needs to do a good job of protecting the holder's PII. @jandrieu is concerned that this will result in a user's data rights being infringed upon. @msporny noted that we need to find the right balance of respecting user data rights and right to leave a system and not accidentally allowing transmission of private keys. @TallTed noted that being able to transmit anything does not equate to being required to transmit everything -- restrictions exist for a reason (dangers posed to individuals).
  
  A PR should be raised that instructs wallet implementers that they must not include a proof that they do not understand in a presentation.

The concept of tagging this repo came up on the Aries WG call on Nov. 15, 2023. I wanted to continue that discussion here:

As prior art, consider this text from: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-plugin-toolbox#aca-py-version-compatibility

> ## ACA-Py Version Compatibility
> 
> To avoid a confusing pseudo-lock-step release, this plugin is versioned independent of ACA-Py. Plugin releases will follow standard [semver](semver.org) but each release will also be tagged with a mapping to an ACA-Py version with the format `acapy-X.Y.Z-J` where `X.Y.Z` corresponds to the ACA-Py version supported and `J` is an incrementing number for each new plugin release that targets the same version of ACA-Py.
> 
> You should look for the most recent release tagged with the version of ACA-Py you are using (with the highest value for `J`).

This was a convention that the toolbox plugin adopted (back when we were actively working on it). I think tagging the whole repo will be challenging to do meaningfully; for the toolbox plugin, we needed to keep track changes of the plugin itself as well as the versions of ACA-Py it was compatible with. The plugins should be able to evolve and gain features and be able to version themselves to communicate when new features are added.
