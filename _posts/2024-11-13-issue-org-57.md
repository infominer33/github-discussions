We are interested in dedicating time at TPAC to hear from working group members using DIDs. We would like to aim for shorter presentations (under 15m or so) that showcase real-world usage of DIDs.

Please note your intent to present (topic and requested time) here.

Additionally, if there are other topics you would like to see discussed during TPAC please suggest them here.
