excerpt: >
  Web 7.0 is on a slightly different trajectory: https://github.com/Web7Foundation/Specifications/blob/main/methods/did-ns-1-0-1.md#variations    > Three (3) variations of the did:ns DID method are currently supported.  >   > - DID Name System over DNS (DIDNS/DNS) (reference implementation)  > - DID Name System over Microsoft Active Directory/Azure Directory Services (DIDNS/AD)  > - DID Name System over X.500/LDAP (DIDNS/LDAP)  >   > This specification describes the design of the DIDNS/DNS reference implementation.     I will close this issue.
