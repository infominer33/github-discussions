  Hi @andrewwhitehead, your feedback is a valid consideration.
  
  Please checkout the [Super/Meta Proposal](https://github.com/w3c/did-extensions/issues/597) that proposes the inclusion in the spec of multiple _authentication of unique DID Method names_ approaches (in addition to the one described here) and the one @manu described elsewhere.

**URL:** https://github.com/w3c/did-extensions/issues/590

For example, 
- did:ns -> http://did-ns.directory
- did: object -> http://did-object.directory

There would be *no requirement* to implement or use the registered domain. It would be like buying an automobile license plate and never placing it on a vehicle (which is OK).

Second, this would remove the W3C from the _conflicting method name_ problem.

Third, existing W3C registrations would be "grandfathered in"; i.e. not required to have the DNS name registration but it would still be recommended.

Other thoughts?
