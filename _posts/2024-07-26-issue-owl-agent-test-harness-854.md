There is now a [Controller Document specification](https://w3c.github.io/controller-document/) that is on the W3C Recommendation Track through the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group. It is, fundamentally, the DID Core specification but generalized to just the document (not resolution) and allows any URL. The DID Core specification might want to use that specification as the base specification (as it can be done in a way that won't change implementations).
