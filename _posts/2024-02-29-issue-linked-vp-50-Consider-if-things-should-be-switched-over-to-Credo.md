Instructions, git command to pull the repo, documentation, comments etc all refer to Aries-Framework-Javascript. This has been replaced by the move to Credo-TS so Akrida should(?) reference that instead.

As well imports in the `package.json` like `@aries-framework/core`, `@aries-framework/node` on 0.4.0 versions do not continue to be updated and the 0.5.x updates look to be released and updated under `@credo-ts/node` etc on npm.
