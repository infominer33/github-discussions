**URL:** https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-docs/pull/99

This PR fixes the **extended proof chain test vectors** to  use all four public/private key pairs as documented in the specification text. The previous test vectors repeated the use of public/private key number 3 rather than using key number 4. **Note**: test vectors are ***informative***.
