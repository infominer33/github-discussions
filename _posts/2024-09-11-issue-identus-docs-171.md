I am currently working on a project where I need to modify the behavior of the Aries mediator service, specifically in the areas of keylist management and message forwarding. However, I am unsure where to start, particularly because the mediator is deployed via a Docker image.

Could you please provide guidance on where I can find the source code associated with the Docker image used for the mediator service? Additionally, any advice on how to proceed with customizing the service to alter the handling of keylists and message forwarding would be greatly appreciated.
