**URL:** https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/102

I am trying to implement the eddsa-jcs-2022 cryptosuite. The specification says:

```
§ 3.3.1 Create Proof (eddsa-jcs-2022)
2) If unsecuredDocument.@context is present, set proof.@context to unsecuredDocument.@context.
```

The Test Vectors at https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-eddsa/#representation-eddsa-jcs-2022 do not reflect that requirement. Do I misunderstand something or are the test vectors outdated?
