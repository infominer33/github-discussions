Estimate of the daily transaction volume of each scope/domain (as an indicator of market size/opportunity) For example: &gt; MWH&gt; What is an estimate of the number of business documents exchanged every day in the world? ChatGPT&gt; The number of business documents exchanged daily worldwide is enormous, reflecting the scale of global commerce and communication. While exact statistics are difficult to pinpoint, industry estimates and studies suggest: 1. Global Estimates: The IDC (International Data Corporation) estimated in recent years that the world generates over 330 billion emails per day, many of which are business-related. E-invoicing and electronic documents alone account for over billions of exchanges daily. For example, the Billentis Report estimates over 550 billion e-invoices and related business documents are exchanged annually, averaging around 1.5 billion daily. 2. Physical Documents: Traditional paper-based business documents (contracts, reports, forms, etc.) add significantly to this number, particularly in industries still transitioning to digital formats. 3. Document Types: Examples of business documents include invoices, purchase orders, contracts, shipping documents, tax forms, and internal reports. Conclusion: A reasonable estimate places the daily exchange of business documents (both digital and physical) in the billions, likely ranging from 3 to 5 billion daily, depending on the context and medium of exchange. &gt; MWH&gt; How many people fly every day? ChatGPT&gt; On an average day, approximately 2.9 million airline passengers travel worldwide, with the United States alone accounting for about 45,000 flights serving domestic and international travelers. Globally, estimates suggest that the number of daily flights surpasses 100,000, carrying millions of people between various destinations. &gt; MWH&gt; What is an estimate of the average number of car parts manufactured per day? ChatGPT&gt; The global automotive industry manufactures an immense number of car parts daily. Estimates suggest that over 30 million individual components are produced each day. This figure reflects the large variety of parts needed for vehicles, including engines, transmissions, batteries, electronics, and other structural and functional components. Key manufacturing hubs, such as China, account for a significant share due to their dominant automotive market and supply chain capabilities, which also contribute to the high global output. Other major regions include Europe, the United States, and emerging markets like India. This production volume is driven by both Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) demand for new vehicles and the aftermarket for vehicle repairs and upgrades. &gt; MWH&gt; What is an estimate of the number of drivers licenses in the world? ChatGPT&gt; The number of driver’s licenses worldwide is estimated to be around 1.8 to 2 billion. This estimate is based on the global population of approximately 8 billion and varying rates of car ownership and license issuance across regions. In developed countries, where car ownership is higher, a significant majority of adults hold a driver’s license. For example, in the U.S., over 87% of adults have a license. However, in developing nations, this proportion is typically much lower due to differences in economic status and urbanization. &gt; MWH&gt; What is an estimate of the number of times per day that a people in the world have to present their driver’s license for identification purposes? ChatGPT&gt; Estimating the number of times driver’s licenses are presented daily for identification worldwide is challenging due to varying practices across regions and uses beyond driving. However, an educated approximation can be derived based on key scenarios where licenses are commonly required: 1. Traffic Stops and Checkpoints: Globally, billions of licensed drivers encounter routine traffic stops or checkpoints annually. For instance, in the U.S. alone, about 50,000 vehicle stops occur daily, many requiring license presentation. 2. Vehicle Rentals, Banking, and Identification: Driver’s licenses are widely used as primary identification for services like car rentals, bank transactions, and even age verification. With billions of transactions daily in banking and retail, a fraction involves license presentation. 3. Public and Private Sector Usage: Many countries mandate driver’s licenses as valid IDs for administrative purposes. For example, countries like the U.S. and Canada heavily rely on them in daily operations. Estimated Total: Considering these contexts: If even 5-10% of the 2 billion license holders globally present their licenses daily, the total ranges between 100 million to 200 million instances per day. This estimate may vary by region, urbanization, and dependence on licenses for non-driving activities. If you want data on a specific country or context, let me know! &gt; MWH&gt; How many valid passports are there in the world and how many times per day are they presented for identification purposes? ChatGPT&gt; As of 2023, there were approximately 160.7 million valid U.S. passports alone, and global estimates suggest over 800 million valid passports worldwide. This reflects an increase in international travel and the expansion of passport issuance globally. Regarding daily presentations for identification, passports are commonly used at border crossings, airports, and official transactions requiring high-security ID verification. With over 2.3 million people crossing international borders daily, passports are presented multiple times during travel (e.g., at departure and arrival). Additionally, passports are sometimes used for banking, legal, or other high-security processes, … &gt; MWH&gt; How many different pizza toppings are there and how many servings of these toppings are consumed daily in the world? ChatGPT&gt; Number of Different Pizza Toppings There are thousands of potential pizza toppings worldwide, ranging from classic options like pepperoni and mushrooms to more unusual regional choices such as: Traditional Toppings: Pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, and peppers. Regional Specialties: Japan: Squid, eel, and mayonnaise. Brazil: Green peas, corn, and bananas. India: Paneer, curry chicken, and tandoori spices. Global Gourmet: Truffle oil, caviar, and exotic cheeses like gorgonzola. While a comprehensive count is difficult due to constant culinary innovations, estimates suggest at least 2,000–3,000 distinct toppings exist globally, considering all cultural and gourmet variations. — Number of Topping Servings Consumed Daily Pizza consumption patterns help estimate the servings of toppings consumed: 1. Pizza Consumption: Daily global consumption: Approximately 13.7 million pizzas. Servings per pizza: Each pizza typically serves 2–3 people. This results in roughly 27–41 million pizza servings daily. 2. Topping Servings: Most pizzas feature 3–4 toppings on average. This leads to 81–164 million individual servings of toppings consumed daily, assuming a balanced distribution. — Pizza’s versatility and cultural integration ensure its enduring global popularity, with toppings evolving to reflect local tastes and trends." />

                  <p>A few that come to mind based on discussions with various community members over the last several months:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>At least one ephemeral DID Method should be identified for standardization. These are useful for short-lived, secure
 communication. Examples include did:key and did:jwk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least one web-based DID Method should be identified for standardization. These are useful for issuers of verifiable
 credentials and other forms of attestations who know how to manage web domains but are not willing to depend on blockchains or DHTs for their root of trust (i.e., governments). Examples include did:web and did:tdw (the incubated at DIF / Province of BC version).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least one “fully decentralized” DID Method should be identified for standardization. These are useful because they achieve what the other two classes of DID Method above don’t achieve – the vision for why we created DIDs in the first place. Examples include did:dht.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Global government-approved crypto” is important to ensure governments can adopt the DID Method. Examples include ECDSA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Privacy-preserving crypto” is important, even if not government approved, to ensure the privacy of individuals. Examples include BBS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A digitally signed cryptographic log of changes to the DID Document is a useful feature to standardize on its own (so that multiple DID Methods could utilize the feature).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A multi-factor binding to DNS is an important feature to standardize on its own (so that domain owners can provide an extra level of security on their DID Documents).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A specification with multiple implementers is always preferable to inventing something new unless the community is behind the concept that the “something new” is necessary.</p>
  </li>

                  <p>I think this is a great list @msporny. The <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/main/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_DID_Methods_Operating_Addendum_v1.pdf">WG’s Operating Addendum</a> also contains a few possible (high-level) criteria for the selection process (in section 4.4 “Evaluation Criteria for DID Methods”), which I am copying here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alignment with DID Core specification</li>
  <li>Interoperability with other DID methods</li>
  <li>Security and privacy features</li>
  <li>Scalability and performance</li>
  <li>Ease of implementation and use</li>
  <li>Community adoption and support</li>
  <li>Compliance with relevant regulations and best practices</li>
  <li>Diversity of the set of selected methods</li>
</ul>

                  <p>@msporny, @peacekeeper this is a great requirements list.  Given the trademark issues that have come up lately, I propose that we add a step that will address trademarks as a quick ad hoc check during registration.</p>

<p>Reading the other issues / comments, I reflected on the fact that this is an international body and that copyrights, trademarks, &amp; patents are national issues that don’t apply internationally.  For example, someone could get a copyright in the US, which would apply only within the US and nowhere else.  Similarly, a European copyright would be enforceable within Europe, but not enforceable within Asia (unless nations have additional treaties).</p>

<p>This leads to the recent dilemma – should this WG approve a DID Method request in light of potential copyright, trademark, or patent issues?</p>

<p>I don’t think this is the right place for such a debate, because those rights / limitations are only valid within the country of issuance.  For example, if a patent holder receives a US patent, but not a EU patent, then the invention is legally implementable in Europe without patent restrictions.  That may cause hard feelings, but that is how the laws are written.</p>

<p>So, what should we do?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/policy-2024-02-21-en">ICANN Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy</a> has some very interesting requirements.  Two items stood out to me:</p>

<p>1) Paragraph 2:  the submitter warrants that they are not <em>knowingly</em> infringing on someone else’s rights</p>

<p>2) Paragraph 3:  “We will cancel, transfer or otherwise make changes to domain name registrations under the following circumstances:” “… our receipt of an order from a court or arbitral tribunal, in each case of competent jurisdiction, requiring such action; and/or”</p>

<p>What that means is that ICANN deferred the initial due diligence back to the submitter and instructed any parties claiming infringement to have their claim adjudicated by their governing legal authority.  This keeps ICANN out of the debate while processing and complying with official legal rulings.</p>

<p>Does that process sound reasonable for our purposes?</p>

                  <p>It seems worth putting the substantial time and energy invested in the DID Rubric to work in this process.</p>

<p>If there are considerations/criteria above which are not yet part of the Rubric, it seems they should be added.</p>

<p>It seems likely that the ranked-choice poll <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/issues/10#issue-2694689431">described above</a> might be satisfactorily run then, targeting the Rubric’s criteria for ranking.</p>

<p>Theoretically, a long-ish list of candidate DID Methods could then be assessed, based on the Rubric, which results could then lead to a <em>short</em> list of candidate DID Methods based on how they fit with the ranked-choice poll above…</p>

<p>There’s nothing easy about this. Much of it is more subjective than not, so applying the Rubric to the candidate DID Methods might require setting up (something like) a spreadsheet into which multiple people could put their Rubric assessments, which could then be averaged to arrive at our “working” (i.e., not carved in stone, not meant to be inherited for use elsewhere, meant <em>only</em> for purposes of <em>this</em> standardization effort) Rubric assessment….</p>

<p>Just some thoughts.</p>

                  <p>This is a great discussion! A few additional points I think we should consider to ensure robust and inclusive DID Methods:</p>

<p><strong>Governance</strong>: Clear frameworks for updates, dispute resolution, and decision-making are essential for trust and longevity.
 <strong>Usability</strong>: Simple implementation for developers and intuitive UX for end users will drive adoption.
 <strong>Sustainability</strong>: Environmental impact matters—methods should prioritize energy efficiency and eco-friendly infrastructure.
 <strong>Economic Feasibility</strong>: DIDs costs of use must be reasonable for individuals, small businesses, and governments, especially in developing regions.
 <strong>Legal Recognition</strong>: Cross-border frameworks for DID acceptance are critical for government and enterprise adoption.
 <strong>Revocation and Recovery</strong>: Decentralized mechanisms for key rotation and DID recovery should be a standard.
 <strong>Emerging Markets</strong>: Offline-friendly, low-bandwidth solutions are key for inclusivity.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that if we address these points, it will make DIDs more impactful globally.</p>

                  <p>Additional requirements:  1. The scope/domain of the types of entities/subjects addressed/named by a particular method 2. Estimated size of each scope/domain (number of individual entities) 3. Estimate of the daily transaction volume of each scope/domain (as an indicator of market size/opportunity)  For example:  &gt; MWH&gt; What is an estimate of the number of business documents exchanged every day in the world?  ChatGPT&gt; The number of business documents exchanged daily worldwide is enormous, reflecting the scale of global commerce and communication. While exact statistics are difficult to pinpoint, industry estimates and studies suggest:  1. Global Estimates:  The IDC (International Data Corporation) estimated in recent years that the world generates over 330 billion emails per day, many of which are business-related.  E-invoicing and electronic documents alone account for over billions of exchanges daily. For example, the Billentis Report estimates over 550 billion e-invoices and related business documents are exchanged annually, averaging around 1.5 billion daily.  2. Physical Documents:  Traditional paper-based business documents (contracts, reports, forms, etc.) add significantly to this number, particularly in industries still transitioning to digital formats.  3. Document Types:  Examples of business documents include invoices, purchase orders, contracts, shipping documents, tax forms, and internal reports.  Conclusion:  A reasonable estimate places the daily exchange of business documents (both digital and physical) in the billions, likely ranging from 3 to 5 billion daily, depending on the context and medium of exchange.  &gt; MWH&gt; How many people fly every day?  ChatGPT&gt; On an average day, approximately 2.9 million airline passengers travel worldwide, with the United States alone accounting for about 45,000 flights serving domestic and international travelers. Globally, estimates suggest that the number of daily flights surpasses 100,000, carrying millions of people between various destinations.  &gt; MWH&gt; What is an estimate of the average number of car parts manufactured per day?  ChatGPT&gt; The global automotive industry manufactures an immense number of car parts daily. Estimates suggest that over 30 million individual components are produced each day. This figure reflects the large variety of parts needed for vehicles, including engines, transmissions, batteries, electronics, and other structural and functional components.  Key manufacturing hubs, such as China, account for a significant share due to their dominant automotive market and supply chain capabilities, which also contribute to the high global output. Other major regions include Europe, the United States, and emerging markets like India.  This production volume is driven by both Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) demand for new vehicles and the aftermarket for vehicle repairs and upgrades.  &gt; MWH&gt; What is an estimate of the number of drivers licenses in the world?  ChatGPT&gt; The number of driver’s licenses worldwide is estimated to be around 1.8 to 2 billion. This estimate is based on the global population of approximately 8 billion and varying rates of car ownership and license issuance across regions. In developed countries, where car ownership is higher, a significant majority of adults hold a driver’s license. For example, in the U.S., over 87% of adults have a license. However, in developing nations, this proportion is typically much lower due to differences in economic status and urbanization.  &gt; MWH&gt; What is an estimate of the number of times per day that a people in the world have to present their driver’s license for identification purposes?  ChatGPT&gt; Estimating the number of times driver’s licenses are presented daily for identification worldwide is challenging due to varying practices across regions and uses beyond driving. However, an educated approximation can be derived based on key scenarios where licenses are commonly required:  1. Traffic Stops and Checkpoints:  Globally, billions of licensed drivers encounter routine traffic stops or checkpoints annually. For instance, in the U.S. alone, about 50,000 vehicle stops occur daily, many requiring license presentation.  2. Vehicle Rentals, Banking, and Identification:  Driver’s licenses are widely used as primary identification for services like car rentals, bank transactions, and even age verification. With billions of transactions daily in banking and retail, a fraction involves license presentation.  3. Public and Private Sector Usage:  Many countries mandate driver’s licenses as valid IDs for administrative purposes. For example, countries like the U.S. and Canada heavily rely on them in daily operations.  Estimated Total:  Considering these contexts:  If even 5-10% of the 2 billion license holders globally present their licenses daily, the total ranges between 100 million to 200 million instances per day.  This estimate may vary by region, urbanization, and dependence on licenses for non-driving activities. If you want data on a specific country or context, let me know!  &gt; MWH&gt; How many valid passports are there in the world and how many times per day are they presented for identification purposes?  ChatGPT&gt; As of 2023, there were approximately 160.7 million valid U.S. passports alone, and global estimates suggest over 800 million valid passports worldwide. This reflects an increase in international travel and the expansion of passport issuance globally.  Regarding daily presentations for identification, passports are commonly used at border crossings, airports, and official transactions requiring high-security ID verification. With over 2.3 million people crossing international borders daily, passports are presented multiple times during travel (e.g., at departure and arrival). Additionally, passports are sometimes used for banking, legal, or other high-security processes, …  &gt; MWH&gt; How many different pizza toppings are there and how many servings of these toppings are consumed daily in the world?  ChatGPT&gt; Number of Different Pizza Toppings  There are thousands of potential pizza toppings worldwide, ranging from classic options like pepperoni and mushrooms to more unusual regional choices such as:  Traditional Toppings: Pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, and peppers.  Regional Specialties:  Japan: Squid, eel, and mayonnaise.  Brazil: Green peas, corn, and bananas.  India: Paneer, curry chicken, and tandoori spices.  Global Gourmet: Truffle oil, caviar, and exotic cheeses like gorgonzola.  While a comprehensive count is difficult due to constant culinary innovations, estimates suggest at least 2,000–3,000 distinct toppings exist globally, considering all cultural and gourmet variations.  —  Number of Topping Servings Consumed Daily  Pizza consumption patterns help estimate the servings of toppings consumed:  1. Pizza Consumption:  Daily global consumption: Approximately 13.7 million pizzas.  Servings per pizza: Each pizza typically serves 2–3 people.  This results in roughly 27–41 million pizza servings daily.  2. Topping Servings:  Most pizzas feature 3–4 toppings on average.  This leads to 81–164 million individual servings of toppings consumed daily, assuming a balanced distribution.  —  Pizza’s versatility and cultural integration ensure its enduring global popularity, with toppings evolving to reflect local tastes and trends.</p>
