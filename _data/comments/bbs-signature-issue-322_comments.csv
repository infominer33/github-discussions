I'm ambivalent wrt. the need to do this as it won't affect any of the current implementations, AFAICT. I'm fine to do it for reasons of completeness.   Wondering what @dlongley feels about all of the above?   In any case, I raised PR https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-integrity/pull/320 to address this issue. This issue will be closed once PR https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-integrity/pull/320 has been merged."

The controller is identified by the `controller` property. I.e., I do not think the class name should change."
