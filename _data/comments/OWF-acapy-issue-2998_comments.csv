It should be included in the lastest version by default.  Just a heads up, apart from `anoncreds`, I also had to install other packages. So the missing packages were, - `anoncreds` - `aries_askar` - `indy_credx` - `indy_vdr`  PS: for anyone wondering/facing this issue simply install the above mentioned packages individually by, `pip install package-name`"
