I was just trying to figure out what would address your concern and convey that I understood where you are coming from. :)  Rewriting every algorithm that we have in that form would 1) confuse non-RDF implementers, and 2) be such a huge task as to put the work behind by months (and would make all of the review we've had by implementers on the current algorithms effectively moot... we'd have to start over).  We state that any algorithm that's equivalent is allowable in the algorithms, IIRC, and that's enough for those that want to implement this stuff in a pure RDF environment (which, as you know, we are not chartered to do).  I don't think there is much we can do here that won't greatly destabilize specs that are hitting a high level of stability.  WDYT?"

There is also https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-integrity/issues/315#issuecomment-2424992041, but I trust you will do this at some point in the near future.  I let you decide whether you want to close the issue now or when that overall editorial pass is done."
