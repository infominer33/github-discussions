Each category of DID methods (_cluster of DID Methods_) would be managed by its own independent circle. A circle member can belong to more than 1 circle. Circles are _connected_ to a parent circle for administrative purposes.  The parent circle would correspond to the DID Method WG (co-chaired by Markus)."
