That being said, this will be helpful for future versions of the specification.  Here is an initial shot at the verbiage to add to the Introduction: cc: @peacekeeper   Intended Audience  This specification's primary audience is implementors of systems and services that use decentralized systems technologies (e.g. decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials). The intended audience includes, but is not limited to, software architects, data modelers, application developers, services developers, testers, operators, and user experience (UX) specialists. In addition, other people involved in a broad range of standards efforts related to decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, and secure storage may also be interested in reading this specification."

2477065796,mwherman2000,2024-11-14T17:54:49+00:00,Sure.  Most likely not until next week.  Hopefully before the next meeting.
