I think I'm spamming the `processIssuedCredentialMessage` method because I'm getting flooded with EVERY message (past and present) from Pluto every time I open my app and start receiving messages

CD should be handling it correctly.    `CFNOTIFICATIONCENTER_IS_CALLING_OUT_TO_AN_OBSERVER` would suggest that this operation is either being called from the wrong thread or there's a notification happening from the wrong thread.
