Which I guess means that it's no longer opaque. So basically this should be part of the protocol considerations of whatever protocol is producing and consuming such identifiers. So basically this should be an ActivityPub concern (for example).  Although I think that at least for the purposes of DID specs, a quick note about query parameter ordering wouldn't be amiss. For example in https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#did-parameters or something."
