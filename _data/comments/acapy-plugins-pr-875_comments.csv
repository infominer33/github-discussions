1903145221,dlongley,2025-01-04T19:48:49+00:00,"Hmm, this seems like it could be more clearly stated like this:  ```suggestion         In the example above, the DID document for <code>did:example:123456789abcdefghi</code> defines two verificationMethods, <code>#keys-1</code> and <code>#keys-2</code>, that can be used for the purpose of capability delegation. This means that these verification methods can be used to verify delegated capabilities issued by <code>did:example:123456789abcdefghi</code>. ```  Notably, a root capability may not be ""issued"" at all -- except perhaps conceptually from the target / system of authority -- and yet if the controller (of that root capability) were `did:example:123456789abcdefghi`, then that entity could still delegate it by using this verification method. Further, the verification method isn't really used to ""produce"" a delegated capability (aka ""a delegation""), but rather to verify one."
