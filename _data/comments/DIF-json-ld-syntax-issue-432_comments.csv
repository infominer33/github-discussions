The reason for this is that if they aren't being used for delivery of a credential, then whether an additional process is required can be handled by the coordinator in any way whatsoever prior to making calls to the issuer API. So, we should focus this consideration on workflows/exchanges.  Now, for workflows/exchanges, the current design has some primitives in it already that are thought to cover this sort of situation and others like it. In particular, a VC API exchange does not require any VCs to be returned (issued) when it terminates *and* it can return a `redirectUrl` to continue the interaction. I can't link directly to this, but see these sections for `redirectUrl`:  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/#participate-in-an-exchange https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/#workflows-and-exchanges   Therefore, the thought is that, for a process that requires additional interaction / approval prior to issuance the exchange would return a `redirectUrl` to send a user back to a coordinator website where it can tell the user that their request has been accepted and that they will be notified (by some coordinator+user-determined means) when they can return to be issued any VC(s). In theory, these primitives should enable a number of more complex / interesting flows to be built without having to specialize further."
