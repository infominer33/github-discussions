It is a runtime security check on the message received via the API, and not a logical invariant.  I suspect an enhancement here would be to describe relying party behavior when a verification step fails across the entire section.  I will add that as a consumer of the API I did not have any confusion on this particular element of this section - but I'm on the ""experienced"" end of the spectrum when it comes to these sorts of systems."
