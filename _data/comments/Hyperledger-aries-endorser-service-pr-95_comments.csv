1836922978,aljones15,2024-11-11T16:24:20+00:00,"@TallTed this looks like a typo resulting from my cut and paste job. The line reads: ""The publicKeyMultibase value of the verification method MUST start with the base-58-btc prefix (z), as defined in the [Multibase section](https://www.w3.org/TR/controller-document/#multibase-0) of [Controller Documents 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/controller-document/)"" The A belongs to the next sentence: ""A Multibase-encoded ECDSA 256-bit public key value or an ECDSA 384-bit public key value follows, as defined in the [Multikey section](https://www.w3.org/TR/controller-document/#Multikey) of [Controller Documents 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/controller-document/). Any other encoding MUST NOT be allowed.""  So the A should be removed."
