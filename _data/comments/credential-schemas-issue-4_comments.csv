Sociocracy means governance by those who associate together. This book is based on the Sociocratic Circle-Organization Method (SCM) developed in the Netherlands by electrical engineer Gerard Endenburg, based on earlier work of educator Kees Boeke.Many Voices One Song includes step-by-step descriptions for structuring organizations, making decisions, and generating feedback. The content is illustrated by many diagrams, tables, examples, lists, skits, and stories from the field. The book includes a glossary and index, and an appendix summarizing processes in easily reproducible form.The book covers four major areas:Sociocratic organizational structures based on linked teams (circles) that distribute authority from the top of organizations to the most frontline teams that are appropriate. These teams are linked by both top-down leaders and bottom-up delegates to ensure that influence and power are shared in a circular rather than linear hierarchy. Organizational diagrams illustrate different ways to structure organizations in an egalitarian way.Decision making by consent, defined as no one having an objection to a proposed decision. Consent is a participatory and inclusive approach to decision making, in contrast to win-lose voting and most forms of consensus. Decision-making steps (understand-explore-decide) detailed include proposal generation and the proposal to consent decision-making process.The book also outlines the steps for selection of people to roles in open dialog processes. The insights of compassionate communication (Nonviolent Communication/NVC) are integrated into the context of decision making.Meeting format and design, including facilitation skills and processes that ensure that all voices matter in decision making.Feedback processes for evaluating the effectiveness of meetings, policies, workflows, and role performance support an ongoing learning cycle and continuous improvement, not just in production and delivery but in the embodiment of equality itself.The intent of this book is to contribute to the spread of sociocracy by making information available. Egalitarian self-governance needs to be simple enough so everyone can share power in a healthy way.  cc: @kimdhamilton @peacekeeper "

2501284435,mwherman2000,2024-11-26T16:16:08+00:00,"> This may introduce more complexity than needed  **Not true**. There has been no opportunity to present, discuss, nor agree on this point.  Background  Yesterday I met with [Ted Rau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-rau-bb75a513b/), the founder of https://www.sociocracyforall.org/, to specifically discuss our project.  We developed a light version of Sociocracy that has a gradual approach to being used in context tuned for our project.  However, if the ED has already ruled that it's ""too complex"", there is no point in preparing anything for further discussion.  > proposing this at a future meeting for consideration by the WG and its chairs  ...is equivalent to burying the topic. If it is to be properly vetted, the time is now."

Please let me know what has changed in between, or let me know if you would like me to share the notes from our conversation."
2503153189,mwherman2000,2024-11-27T07:53:09+00:00,@kimdhamilton Apparently we need to start recording our conversations for authentication.   I expressed my disgust with your unilateral move on the call (unilateral with no prior consultation). Nothing from my perspective has changed.  You didn't change your post - so nothing appears to have changed from your side either.
