Since `AuthenticatorAttestationResponseJSON.publicKeyAlgorithm` is meant to reflect the non-JSON field, and `AuthenticatorAttestationResponseJSON` is constructed by the client which clearly already knows the `publicKeyAlgorithm` value since it's required in the non-JSON, there's not much reason for it not to be required in the JSON dictionary too. Keeping it required in both dictionaries is more consistent. Therefore we decided on the 2024-10-30 WG call to close this (it just took me a few weeks to get around to doing it...)."
