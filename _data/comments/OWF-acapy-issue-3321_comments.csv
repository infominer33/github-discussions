E.g. that the wallet knows who the verifier is via a VC before responding.   If you are going to use AnonCreds for that, you do need to have a presentation request before the presentation. That is because the presentation request has required data necessary to construct the request -- at minimum a nonce to ensure replaying of a VC is not possible.  The Wallet could have a pre-defined list of ""valid"" verifiers by DID/identitifier, or could use a trust registry to look up the DID/identifier of the verifier before responding.  We are working on a concept called ""<did>/whois"" for this type of purpose -- a distributed Trust Registry concept. Given a published, resolvable DID, support (ideally, across all published DID Methods) the endpoint <did>/whois, which returns a W3C signed VP containing VCs about the DID and/or the entity behind the DID -- e.g. a VC issued by a ""trusted"" registry.  Given that, the Presentation Request from a unknown verifier could come in and the wallet could use the DID of Verifier to resolve `<did>/whois` to find out what is known about the verifier.  For details:  > We talked about this at yesterday's ID Working Group call, and it was suggested that I post this notice, get an feedback and we can have a formal request to start the work item at the next call.
