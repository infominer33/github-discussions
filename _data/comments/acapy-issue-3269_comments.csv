2501737517,jamshale,2024-11-26T19:16:22+00:00,"In `[acapy-tools](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy-tools)` I don't think there is any instructions :/ . It's pretty simple though. I just `poetry install` and then navigate to `askar_tools` and run `poetry run pytest .`.  You can use other pytest commands to run an individual test. "

2501781139,jamshale,2024-11-26T19:42:46+00:00,I agree. For this scenario testing against a postgres db would be easier and better. The sqlite testing was much more difficult with restarts in acapy-tools. Also would be good to have postgres getting tested more here in general.
