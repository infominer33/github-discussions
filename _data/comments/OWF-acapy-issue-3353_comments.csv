2498572875,jamshale,2024-11-25T17:06:03+00:00,This looks like a problem with the default universal resolver `GET https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/properties` response changing. No idea why it changed. I don't think any acapy changes caused this. Looks like a breaking change with the universal resolver service.

2498591480,jamshale,2024-11-25T17:14:31+00:00,The default is the dev universal resolver. So it might be expected to have breaking changes. It's an easy update in acapy. Creating a PR.
