This would, however, not be backwards compatible with existing RP implementations that (intentionally or accidentally) rely on duplicates being silently ignored.  I agree that throwing an error is a bad approach. But, adding some notes explicitly make the readers and developers to clearly understand how the underlying client and authenticator would work."
