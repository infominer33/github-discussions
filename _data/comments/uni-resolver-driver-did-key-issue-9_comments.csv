Participants discussed challenges in achieving interoperability among various DID Methods, ensuring security and scalability, and addressing the diverse needs of stakeholders across industries. A need for DID Methods to be standardized was a core focus. Topics included refining existing specifications, promoting best practices and features, and aligning efforts with existing specifications for decentralized identity systems.  The group's mission is to establish a standardized framework for DID Methods and identify a few that need standardization, ensuring compatibility and reliability across platforms. By focusing on cross-community collaboration and standardization, the participants aim to create a flexible and inclusive system that supports innovation while maintaining a commitment to core principles of decentralization, privacy, and user control.  Key takeaways included a shared dedication to overcoming fragmentation in the DID ecosystem, fostering interoperability through standardization of specific features and specifications, and ensuring the technical and ethical robustness of proposed standards so that they might be used by global society. The group stressed the importance of community engagement and real-world testing to inform the ongoing development of these specifications toward standardization at global standards setting organizations.  -- manu  -- Manu Sporny - https://www.linkedin.com/in/manusporny/ Founder/CEO - Digital Bazaar, Inc. https://www.digitalbazaar.com/"

It is not. MWH>> You further emphasized this ""baseline"" point in the following paragraph where you asked people to add any missing requirements (to your baseline).  This approach is inappropriate, overhanded, and needs to be neutered. MWH>> ""I know I'm missing many more requirement ideas, so what are they?

Here's what my full statement said: MANU>> "" All that has been requested asked for (by Kim in the last meeting) is for the members to propose steps for moving forward here (nothing more): https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/issues"" MWH>> This is another CoC issue (#2?) MWH>> In addition, you most always delete the previous context of the thread making it difficult for anyone ready your emails to full understand and appreciate the full and complete context of the issue - tilting/twisting the discussion in your favour.  Yep, which is what I did.  > In addition, I believe Markus's role as the co-chair is to report on progress.

Gathering requirements from the community are among those things that help establish consensus.

It's been documented by myself and others over the years. Here's one example: https://hyperonomy.com/2019/04/09/clique-speak/  > I'm deeply disappointed in seeing this email - to the point where it may be a code-of-conduct violation.  Threatening action such as this for actions performed in good faith,  MWH>> Based on years of 1. similar experiences with you, 2. this specific context, 3. your behaviors demonstrated over the past couple weeks, and 4. this CoC claim, I question your ""good faith"" with full justification.  MANU>> ..as well as the sorts of legal threats you've been engaged in for the past several weeks (threatening legal action over trademarks which you do not have) establish a pattern of behavior that is troubling. MWH>> CCG members, what Manu has stated in the above sentence is an outright lie.  MWH>> First, I am well within my rights to validly claim and contest copyright infringement with respect to ""did:tdw"" and ""Trust DID Web"". Reference: https://github.com/w3c/did-extensions/pull/581#issuecomment-2462828639 MWH>> To try to deny me that right or to try to intimidate, threaten, and/or retaliate is a 3rd CoC violation. MWH>> I have never threatened any legal action.  Manu's claim is a lie. I have claimed trademark infringement. The specific wording I used was: MWH>> "" I have a commercial objection to the approval of did:tdw. ""tdw"" overlaps significantly with the Trusted Digital Web, the parent project of the Web 7.0 Ultraweb."" Reference: https://github.com/w3c/did-extensions/issues/586#issue-2641739874 MWH>> On the other hand, Manu it was yourself who became very heavy-handed, threatening, intimidating, and retaliatory in the DID WG meeting of (I believe) November 14th when in the open Zoom call you threatened me with the size of Digital Bizarre's ""internal legal council"" as well as the size ""internal legal councils"" of the W3C, other government/defense contractor partners, etc. Everyone on the call is a witness to this unacceptable behavior. This unacceptable behavior is included in CoC claim #3. MWH>> Further, the issue has been resolved reasonably amicably in the Steven’s last DIF WG call.  MWH>> To chastise someone for initiating a CoC claim is also a CoC violation. Reference item #23: https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/  This is Coc claim #4.  If you would like to file a code of conduct violation, please do.  MWH>> I have and will further submit the above additional 3 claims.  Best regards, Michael Herman Web 7.0 Foundation  -- manu  -- Manu Sporny - https://www.linkedin.com/in/manusporny/ Founder/CEO - Digital Bazaar, Inc. https://www.digitalbazaar.com/"
2498936655,PatStLouis,2024-11-25T20:10:19+00:00,"This seems grossly unwarranted.   There was examples/suggestions for next steps with an invitation to discuss on a public thread and instead of participating in the conversation you have filed a code of conduct complaint, this doesn't make any sense. Threatening to file 4 additional code of conduct complaints without the current one being resolved/addressed is just harassment.  I second the fact that you have implied legal action by linking to legal documents around trademark infringement and claiming it's in violation of these laws to register the now well know did method `tdw` which has been in the work for a significant amount of time, gaining more recognition as the TDW acronym by search engines and community references. There are multiple tdw projects in dif's repository, all of them associated with this work item.  No one has acknowledged the ""significant overlap"" with the previously mentioned work item of yours, quite the opposite, it was rebuked by many parties involved, not just @msporny .  I was at the last TDW call and I can say that there was a compromise made as the group had no intention in further wasting time on this matter. You also signaled your intention to register tdw as a did method without having a specification, only providing confusion for the community and capitalizing on the work made by others, even if you were advised not to do so. The situation wasn't ""resolved"", the group simply decided to move on as there are more important matters to address than alleged trademark infringements.  It seems to me like you are actively trying to halt all progress made in this working group."

Given this, comments like the above can only be designed to intimidate, threaten, denigrate, and/or retaliate against someone is who has the right to protect their IP/copyrights/trademarks.  MWH>> Related, I have made significant efforts to reach out to  @swcurran, @kimdhamilton and the #cochairs to both resolve this issue as well as present serious solutions to help prevent these situations in the future: - https://github.com/w3c/did-extensions/issues/590 - https://github.com/w3c/did-extensions/issues/597  MWH>> In addition, I have been present, active, and a responsive, positive contributor in every related WG call and discussion since the overall issue was identified.  We're not a bunch of kids playing in a playground sandbox anymore.
