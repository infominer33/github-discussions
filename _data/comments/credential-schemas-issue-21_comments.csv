We marked very few names as mandatory, the reasons for these ones in particular are:  - In certain cases people don't have middle names - In certain cultures people don't use last names  We have corrected `title` and `salutation` to be optional now, thanks for the input!  The `nameFromDate` and `nameToDate` are also optional in the updated version."
