2486742998,msporny,2024-11-19T21:00:35+00:00,"The group discussed this on the 2024-11-19 telecon:  @dlongley explained the issue -- effectively wallets shouldn't present proofs that they don't understand. Wallet implementers need to be warned that they don't have to throw out proof types they don't know, but at the same time, they shouldn't present proofs they don't understand. Proofs that are not understood should never be presented (e.g. base proofs for BBS). @jandrieu asked why the proofs need to be stripped -- @dlongley said that the information might be private to the individual and the ""user agent"" needs to do a good job of protecting the holder's PII. @jandrieu is concerned that this will result in a user's data rights being infringed upon. @msporny noted that we need to find the right balance of respecting user data rights and right to leave a system and not accidentally allowing transmission of private keys. @TallTed noted that being able to transmit anything does not equate to being required to transmit everything -- restrictions exist for a reason (dangers posed to individuals).  A PR should be raised that instructs wallet implementers that they must not include a proof that they do not understand in a presentation."

This applies to verifiable credentials. Have we ever considered that for DIDs? How does that apply to key rotations?</span><br> <span>… this topic needs more high-level discussions.</span></p> <p><cite>burn:</cite> this is about explicit versioning?</p> <p><cite>denkeni:</cite> should you rotate keys or have to change the DID URL?</p> <p><cite>jennieM:</cite> from the start of this WG, this was a topic: what happens when a DID method goes away completely.<br> <span>… we can see that in the minutes from the meeting of Sept 23rd at TPAC.</span></p> <p><cite>&lt;JennieM&gt;</cite> <a href=""https://www.w3.org/2024/09/23-did-minutes.html#t11"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>2024/<wbr>09/<wbr>23-did-minutes.html#t11</a></p> <p><cite>&lt;burn&gt;</cite> drummond: this gets deep fast.</p> <p><cite>&lt;burn&gt;</cite> ... the question of the relationship of the state of a did document to a DID (what we used to call a naked DID, without the URL bits) and potentially to a DID URL which could include identifiers of a state.  Whether its a version, a time, or something else.  This is a complex question.</p> <p><cite>&lt;burn&gt;</cite> ... the original spec is fairly clear about when to use each method.</p> <p><cite>joeandrieu:</cite> this expiry question is a good one.

If not, then that may open a larger question.<br> <span>… it also raises the larger question of whether the root DID document might need an expiration property.</span></p> <p><cite>drummond:</cite> yes, I don't remember that ever coming up, but that could indeed make sense.</p> <p><cite>&lt;denkeni&gt;</cite> <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#key-and-signature-expiration"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>TR/<wbr>did-core/#key-and-signature-expiration</a></p> <p><cite>denken:</cite> I added a link to the section about key and signature expiration in DID Core.<br> <span>… it raises the question of whether this is a DID Core issue, a DID Resolution issue, or a DID method issue.</span><br> <span>… this is relevant because we're going to start DID method standardization.</span><br> <span>… it could also be important for distinguishing between DID methods.</span><br> <span>… some DID methods may want to take responsibility for this control and some won't.</span></p> <p><cite>burn:</cite> I prefer this speed of conversation.
