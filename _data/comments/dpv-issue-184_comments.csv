You are correct that an issuer could list multiple entries in the `credentialSubject` and that the specification doesn't provide guidance on that item.  > It is not possible to use the credentialSubject.id as it is in no way linked to the VC's credentialStatus that is being checked.  The `BitstringStatusListEntry` must contain the `statusListCredential` URL, but we don't require that URL to be used anywhere in the `BitstringStatusList`.   > It is no possible to use credentialSubject.statusPurpose as there might be multiple credential subject with the same statusPurpose.  Yes, that is also true.  > How to pick the correct credential subject for the given credential status check?  At present, the behavior is undefined and is therefore implementation dependent.   If we wanted to say something normative in the specification, we could say that only the first entry in the array that matches the `statusPurpose` wins. This has a downside that the array is supposed to be an unordered set and so the order isn't guaranteed (but maybe we don't care because issuers that create arrays with multiple entries for a statusPurpose are clearly doing it wrong and so we can't guarantee anything if they do that.  We could also require that verifiers scan the entire array to ensure that there are no duplicate statusPurposes in the array, but at the expense of having to do that check (implementation complexity where the upside of the check isn't really valuable -- you're dealing w/ an issuer that has a malformed array).  @antonio-ivanovski did you have any suggestions on what you'd like to see us do in the specification before we try to address your concern?"

Changing one of the example to include the `credentialStatus` as an array with multiple `BitstringStatusList` entries and another entry with type other than `BitstringStatusList`. 2. Have explicitly written the expected behaviour, example: ""first entry in the array that matches the `statusPurpose`"". This way, issuers and verifiers will be aware what to expect and aware what would happen if there are double entries.  As for a way to make this work better, I don't see another path forward as for adding additional binding identification parameter both to `BitstringStatusList` and `BitstringStatusListEntry`. Not sure how much desire there is for this, as the thing being handled here is incorrect usage of the feature."
