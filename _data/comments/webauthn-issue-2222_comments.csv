I think as a rely party can only get its own credentials, this will not cause bad problems. Do you think so?  ________________________________ 发件人: Matthew Miller ***@***.***> 发送时间: 2024年12月27日 8:56 收件人: w3c/webauthn ***@***.***> 抄送: bigradish ***@***.***>; Author ***@***.***> 主题: Re: [w3c/webauthn] Add a method to get all the credentials for a rely party on the client device to support the rely party (website) to limit the number of accounts a user can register (Issue #2222)   It is very easy for a user to register many accounts on a website which using webauthn, but it seems that there is no an easy way to limit this capability of the user, for it is not easy to identify the user or the authenticator...when the user is registering.  I don't entirely understand what is being requested here.

I am highly confident the WebAuthn WG will not support any notion to introduce a capability like this. By way of example, if I have 5 google accounts, Google doesn't need to know, nor should they, that they are all mine. They are completely separate personas that I (as an end user) want distinct for privacy reasons.  If as an RP you're trying to bind an account to a human, then use a 3rd party identity proofing solution (not an authentication technology like WebAuthn) to do that. Real humans will find it difficult to provide the burdens of proof required to satisfy different human identities for many accounts at the same RP."

There isn't even a discovery API to figure out if *any* credential exists at all, let alone provide a number. This is why the ""autofill UI"" (also known as conditional mediation) version of WebAuthn behaves the way it does. The notion of whether or not a credential exists on the client device and is shown in autofill dropdown to the user is not discoverable to the RP until the user decides to use it. The RP is not entitled to know this - again for privacy reasons. "
