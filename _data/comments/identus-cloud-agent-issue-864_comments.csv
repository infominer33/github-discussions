By my reading of https://w3c.github.io/did-resolution/#dereferencing-algorithm-primary (is there something more official I should be looking at instead?), it seems like algorithm step 4.1.1 doesn't account for this ""full IRI external to the DID document"" use case:  > If the input [DID URL](https://w3c.github.io/did-resolution/#dfn-did-urls) contains the [DID parameter](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-parameters) `service` and optionally the `relativeRef` DID parameter: > > [Example 1](https://w3c.github.io/did-resolution/#example-1) > > did:example:1234?service=files&relativeRef=%2Fmyresume%2Fdoc%3Fversion%3Dlatest >  > From the resolved [DID document](https://w3c.github.io/did-resolution/#dfn-did-documents), select the [service endpoint](https://w3c.github.io/did-resolution/#service-endpoint-construction) whose <mark>`id` property contains a fragment which matches the value of the `service` DID parameter</mark> of the input [DID URL](https://w3c.github.io/did-resolution/#dfn-did-urls). This is called the input [service endpoint](https://w3c.github.io/did-resolution/#dfn-service-endpoints).  So for something like  `did:example:abc123?service=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-node.example`  The resolution algorithm above reads in a way that it would fail to match anything -- certainly there is no fragment matching `service=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-jsonld-node.example`, and indeed there is no fragment at all!  ```json {   ""@context"": ""https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1.1"",   ""id"": ""did:example:abc123"",   ""service"": {     ""id"": ""https://external-jsonld-node.example"",     ""serviceEndpoint"": ""https://will-this-ever-match.example""   } } ```  In fact, because of the ""fragment"" matching algo, something like this might be expected to match:  `did:example:abc123?service=example`  ```json {   ""@context"": ""https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1.1"",   ""id"": ""did:example:abc123"",   ""service"": {     ""id"": ""https://this-part-doesnt-actually-matter.example/#example"",     ""serviceEndpoint"": ""https://i-guess-this-matches.example""   } } ```  Should this be filed as a separate issue, and if so, where should I file it?"

Please re-open the issue if you disagree, @SaulMoonves"
