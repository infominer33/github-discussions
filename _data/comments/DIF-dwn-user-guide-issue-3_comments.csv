Different clusters (or subclusters) may want to target different SDOs ...e.g. W3C, IETF, European, ...? - DID Resolution Approach: this however is covered to a large extent by the column labels/horizontal axis -  Others?  Instead of adding more dimensions to the DID Method Clustering Model, we can allow a DID Method to have multiple additional attributes/properties.  These, in turn, can be used to create sub-clusters of methods within a cluster (with corresponding sub-circles and sub-circle membership)."
