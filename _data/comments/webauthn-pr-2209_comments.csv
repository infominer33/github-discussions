If so, it would be nice to add that in the section names. If they do have attestation, then the actual attestation should be added. For example if no attestation is used, this section should be called 'ES256 Credential with No Attestation and ""crossOrigin"": true in clientDataJSON'. Additionally like my first comment, it's less confusing if `attestation_private_key` and `attestation_cert_serial_number` were removed.  I say this since it's not uncommon for RPs to not support attestation—at least non-self attestation—and it would be nice to immediately know which tests are inapplicable/need-to-be-amended without actually parsing `attestationObject` to see if and what attestation is used."
