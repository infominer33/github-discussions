That step was never intended to imply that it is the _only_ allowed way to change a credential nickname. This suggests even more strongly to me that we should just delete `credential record/authenticatorDisplayName` altogether, and if anything just hint vaguely at the idea of allowing users to set a credential nickname."

The authentication section should have been written similarly. Regardless, I don't care enough about this; so if people want it removed, then so be it."
