Wallet implementers need to be warned that they don't have to throw out proof types they don't know, but at the same time, they shouldn't present proofs they don't understand. Proofs that are not understood should never be presented (e.g. base proofs for BBS). @jandrieu asked why the proofs need to be stripped -- @dlongley said that the information might be private to the individual and the ""user agent"" needs to do a good job of protecting the holder's PII. @jandrieu is concerned that this will result in a user's data rights being infringed upon. @msporny noted that we need to find the right balance of respecting user data rights and right to leave a system and not accidentally allowing transmission of private keys. @TallTed noted that being able to transmit anything does not equate to being required to transmit everything -- restrictions exist for a reason (dangers posed to individuals).  A PR should be raised that instructs wallet implementers that they must not include a proof that they do not understand in a presentation."
