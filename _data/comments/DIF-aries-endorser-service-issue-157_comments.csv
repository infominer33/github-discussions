We need the following:  - An up-to-date example credential in VC 2.0 form. - A breakdown of that credential into a concrete example for the prose section.   - Actors: who is the issuer, who is the subject, who is the verifier, etc., rather than just generic terms.   - Validation requirements: What does it take to verify the content. - An example that includes selective redaction.   - What is redacted?   - Why is it redacted?   - How do verifiers work with the document when data has been redacted?  Thanks."
