This is done in [`selectJsonLd`](https://w3c.github.io/vc-di-ecdsa/#selectjsonld) by calling `selectPaths` multiple times on the same selection document in a loop over an array of pointers.  Perhaps this could be done a different (e.g., more functional) way, but notably, implementations are already free to vary any of the algorithms or functions however is preferred provided that the overall outputs are the same.  Note: If you feel this issue doesn't need to be addressed or has been resolved one way or another you are free to close it as you are the issue opener."
